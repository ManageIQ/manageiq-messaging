module ManageIQ
  module Messaging
    # The abstract client class. It defines methods needed to publish or subscribe messages.
    # It is not recommended to directly create a solid subclass instance. The proper way is
    # to call class method +Client.open+ with desired protocol. For example:
    #
    #   client = ManageIQ::Messaging::Client.open(
    #     :protocol  => 'Stomp',
    #     :host       => 'localhost',
    #     :port       => 61616,
    #     :password   => 'smartvm',
    #     :username   => 'admin',
    #     :client_ref => 'generic_1',
    #     :encoding   => 'json'
    #   )
    #
    # To close the connection one needs to explicitly call +client.close+.
    # Alternatively if a block is given for the +open+ method, the connection will be closed
    # automatically before existing the block. For example:
    #
    #   ManageIQ::Messaging::Client.open(
    #     :protocol   => 'Stomp'
    #     :host       => 'localhost',
    #     :port       => 61616,
    #     :password   => 'smartvm',
    #     :username   => 'admin',
    #     :client_ref => 'generic_1'
    #   ) do |client|
    #     # do stuff with the client
    #     end
    #   end
    class Client
      # Open or create a connection to the message broker.
      # Expected +options+ keys are:
      # * :protocol (Implemented: 'Stomp', 'Kafka'. Default 'Stomp')
      # * :host (hostname or IP address of the messaging broker)
      # * :port (host port number)
      # * :username (optional)
      # * :password (optional)
      # * :ssl (true/false)
      # * :ca_file (optional. path to a certificate authority cert)
      # * :encoding ('yaml' or 'json'. Default 'yaml')
      # Other connection options are underlying messaging system specific.
      #
      # Returns a +Client+ instance if no block is given.

      # Expected keys in +options+ are:

      # * :class_name (optional)
      # * :message    (e.g. method name or message type)

      # * :sender     (optional, identify the sender)
      # * :headers    (optional, additional headers to add to the message)

      # an acknowledgment. Not every underlying messaging system supports callback.

      #
