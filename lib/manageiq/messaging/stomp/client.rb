      # Messaging client implementation using Stomp protocol with ActiveMQ Artemis being
      # the underlying supporting system.
      # Do not directly instantiate an instance from this class. Use
      # +ManageIQ::Messaging::Client.open+ method.
      #
      # Artemis specific connection options accepted by +open+ method:
      # * :client_ref (A reference string to identify the client)
      # * :host (Single host name)
      # * :port (host port number)
      # * :username
      # * :password
      # * :heartbeat (Whether the client should do heart-beating. Default to true)
      #
      # Artemis specific +publish_message+ options:
      # * :expires_on
      # * :deliver_on
      # * :priority
      # * :group_name
      #
      # Artemis specific +publish_topic+ options:
      # * :expires_on
      # * :deliver_on
      # * :priority
      #
      # Artemis specific +subscribe_topic+ options:
      # * :persist_ref
      #
      # +:persist_ref+ must be paired with +:client_ref+ option in +Client.open+ method.
      # They jointly create a unique group name. Without such group every topic subscriber
      # receives a copy of each message only when they are active. This is the default.
      # If multiple topic subscribers join with the same group each message is consumed
      # by only one of the subscribers. This allows a load balancing among the subscribers.
      # Also any messages sent when all members of the group are offline will be persisted
      # and delivered when any member in the group is back online. Each message is still
      # copied and delivered to other subscribes belongs to other groups or no group.
      #
      # Artemis specific +subscribe_messages+ options:
      # * :limit ()
